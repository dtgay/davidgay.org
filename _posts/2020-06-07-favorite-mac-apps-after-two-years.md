  Over two years ago, I switched to using a MacBook full time. Here are twenty
  apps that have stuck with me.
title: My Favorite Mac Apps After Two Years
---

Around the beginning of 2018, I made the switch to using a MacBook for
virtually everything I do. I had been a fan of the iPhone for some time and
after a long history with Linux and Windows, I developed an interest in
giving the Mac a try. Since then, I've been using a MacBook Pro pretty much
exclusively.

Over two years later, here's a list of the apps that made it onto my MacBook
and stayed.

<!-- more -->

In no particular order:

## [Things][1]

Okay, this one might actually be in particular order. [Things][1] is possibly
the nicest app I've used in my entire life. It has near-perfect synergy with
how my brain works and it sparks joy every time I use it, which is constantly.
Absolute beauty, keyboard shortcuts, a just-right organizational system, _start
dates_ (oh, how many tasks managers don't have _start dates!_), a helper (for
creating todos from anywhere on your system and automatically adding a link to
the page, email, or whatever that you have open), and the list goes on.

Everything goes into Things. I add articles to read, questions to answer,
things to check on, and minuscule reminders. If it comes to mind, I get it out
of mind, and into Things.

**Other task managers I've tried:** Taskwarrior, Todoist, Apple Reminders,
markdown checkbox lists

## [1Password][2]

[1Password][2] is another app that sparks joy. It's quite pretty and both
the Mac and iPhone apps quickly handle passwords, OTPs, credit card info,
and other sensitive bits with minimal friction. Every other password manager
I've tried feels noticeably worse and doesn't work as well (or as often).

**Other password managers I've tried:** Dashlane, LastPass, pass, KeePass

## [iTerm 2][4]

[iTerm][4], you just have to use it. If you're using the built-in Terminal.app,
you're missing out. That's all there is to say. Install iTerm, get yourself
a nice theme, and learn some shortcuts.

I used [Tmux][5] with iTerm for a while since I was used to in on Linux. I
eventually dropped it because iTerm can do all the things I used tmux for,
plus OS-native window and tab management.

**Other terminal emulators I've tried:** Terminal.app, MobaXterm on Windows,
and many of the Linux offerings

## [Alfred][3]

The [Alfred][3] Powerpack was a huge value purchase. For about $25 I got so
much more than a supercharged launcher. Through built-in features and
open-source "workflows" (extensions), I locate and manipulate files, access
clipboard history, quickly enter snippets like my email address and the
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) face (my word, Lenny doesn't look great in this font), grab contacts,
look up and spell words, do calculations, access [1Password][2], run commands
in [iTerm][4], open GitHub repos, search Stack Overflow/Exchange, control
Spotify, search Smart Folders, and paste emojis.

**Other launchers I've tried:** Spotlight, and assorted Linux and Windows
launchers that completely pale in comparison

## [Backblaze][5]

[Backblaze][5], paired with Time Machine, is the core of my backup strategy.
It's fantastic software that backs up your entire machine with absolutely zero
effort on your part. The best backup system is the one you actually use. And
you'd have to actually _try_ to not run your backup with Backblaze. And
because it backs up everything except the files you tell it not to, there's
super-low friction.

If you're interested, [sign up with this link][6] and we both get a free month.
Otherwise, just use one of the links above.

**Other backup systems I've tried:** I rolled my own backups on Linux and
Windows.

## [TripMode][16]

[TripMode][16] is _so nice_ for absolutely any travel or public wifi use. You
can easily control which programs have access to the network, and how much data
you want to go through. I use it every time I'm working from somewhere other
than my house or office.

## [Calibre][6]

It looks a bit dated (and it is), but [Calibre][6] is a good way to manage
your eBook and PDF library. I mainly use it for converting files between PDF,
EPUB, and MOBI formats, which it does to my satisfaction. Apple Books looks
more modern, but Calibre beats it in usefulness.

**Other eBook managers I've tried:** Apple Books

## [Dozer][7]

[Dozer][7] is a free and open-source alternative to Bartender. It tidies up
your menu bar by hiding the icons you don't want to see. I use Dozer to hide
everything but wifi, battery, and the time.

## [eqMac][8]

MacOS doesn't have a built-in equalizer, and sometimes I like to use one,
especially when playing music on speakers. [eqMac][8] is open-source and
does what it says on the can.

## [Firefox][9]

I tried Safari for a while, but I'm a [Firefox][9] guy at heart. What can I
say. I love the concern for privacy, and Sync is great.

## [GrandPerspective][10]

I know there are sexier disk usage analyzers out there, but
[GrandPerspective][10] is free, and it gets the job done. Sourceforge
throwback.

**Other disk usage analyzers I've tried:** WinDirStat on Windows

## [Insomnia][11]

[Insomnia][11] is both sexier and faster than Postman, and most developers
need a good REST client.

**Other REST clients I've tried:** Postman

## [Karabiner-Elements][12]

Most of the time I'm using my customized [Vortex Pok3r][13], but when I'm on
the built-in keyboard, I have to make some changes. Most importantly,
[Karabiner-Elements][12] lets me map `caps lock` + `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` to arrow
keys. Critical stuff.

## [Amphetamine][14]

Sometimes you don't want your computer to go to sleep. Unfortunately, macOS
needs a little extra help with that. [Amphetamine][14] is free and does the
job.

## [Spotify][15]

The music might not be lossless (Dear Spotify: I'd pay extra!), but
[Spotify][15] has reasonable audio quality, and the selection and convenience
is hard to argue with.

## [VLC][17]

Sometimes, Mac's built-in options don't cut it for media playback, so I use
the tried and true [VLC][17].

## [VimR][18]

[VimR][18] is one for you (Neo)vim fans out there. Sometimes I want to quickly
open and tweak text files from Finder, and [VimR][18] handles that nicely,
allowing me to use Vim and my `.vimrc` along the way.

## [Xnip][19]

[Xnip][19] is the nicest screenshotting tool I've tried. It's smooth, has
plenty of free features, and Just Works™️.

## [Slack][20]

Everyone and their grandmother uses [Slack][20] now, so that means I do, too.
It's alright, though I wish it was native and not Electron.

**Other messaging tools I've used:** IRC (Remember IRC? It's still around.
We could go back; it's not too late. Anyone?)
