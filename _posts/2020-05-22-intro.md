2020 has been a hallmark year for me. Continuing that trend, I've decided to
start blogging again. It has been many years since I blogged. I was a young man
then, spry, and filled to the brim with strong opinions on topics with which I
had a nebulous understanding. Now, going on twenty-seven, the sun is beginning
to set on my youth as I transition into my second year paying for health
insurance. The season for commissioning an [enchanted painting][3] is passing
me by. Heavy falls the veil of twilight years.

This website is meant to be a writing project. I hope it will be enjoyable
reading, but I'm not here for clicks. By keeping this blog I hope to improve my
capacity for conveying ideas and feelings. The scope of topics is ill-defined
and the thesis is absent. All I'm promising is writing.

Like [Deacon Blues][2], I'll play just what I feel. I'll categorize and tag
posts so you can skip hearing about my opinions on notetaking software and get
right to my thoughts on Beck's [Sea Change][1]. Or vice versa. Thanks to the
gifts of computer science, the power is in your hands.
