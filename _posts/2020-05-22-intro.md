2020 has been a hallmark year for me. Continuing that trend, I've decided to
start blogging again. It has been many years since I blogged. I was a young man
then, spry, and filled to the brim with strong opinions on topics with which I
had a nebulous understanding. Now, going on twenty-seven, the sun is beginning
to set on my youth as I transition into my second year paying for health
insurance. The season for commissioning an enchanted painting is passing
me by. Heavy falls the veil of twilight years.

This website is meant to be a writing project. I'll be posting about whatever
I've been thinking about, doing, or learning. The scope of topics is
ill-defined and the thesis is absent. All I'm promising is writing.

I hope it will be enjoyable reading, and maybe even useful.
