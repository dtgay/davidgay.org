I'm a software developer from Central New York.

I've been slinging code since I was little, and have always loved working with
computers, at great personal cost. Every day, my sanity slips through my
fingers like sand, into the cracks of my mechanical keyboard.

Nowadays, I work at [Kirkwork](https://kirkworkllc.com/), where I get to
program in different languages, design products, do cool DevOps things, and
learn. We do all sorts of stuff, so drop us a line if you've got a problem that
needs solving, or if you just want to improve your life through technology.

I'm not looking for alternate employment, but I absolutely love criticizing
people's art. So feel free to send me demos of your latest app, or a website
link, and I'll happily reply with a few thoughtful insults. I offer this
service completely free of charge.
