I'm a software developer from Central New York.

I've been slinging code since I was little, and have always loved working with
computers, at great personal cost. Every day, my sanity slips through my
fingers like sand, into the cracks of my mechanical keyboard.

Nowadays, I work at [Kirkwork](https://kirkworkllc.com/), where I get to
program in different languages, design products, do cool DevOps things, and
learn. We do all sorts of stuff, so drop us a line if you've got a problem that
needs solving, or if you just want to improve your life through technology.
