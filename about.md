Hello! I'm David Gay.

The point of my creating this blog is to write about things that interest me.
I spend a lot of my time doing software development, reading, and listening
to music, so a lot of the content will be about that.

My favorite programming language is Ruby. My first was BASIC. Most recently,
I learned some Clojure.

My favorite book is [Cat's
Cradle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) by Kurt
Vonnegut.

I don't have a favorite band. Some of my favorite albums are The Blue Nile's
[Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hats_(album)) and Van Morrison's
[Astral Weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_Weeks).

I'm the lead software developer at [Kirkwork](https://kirkworkllc.com).

## This Site

This site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay/davidgay.org).

I write all posts and pages in markdown, and then the site is generated by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is a slightly modified
[whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass). I push the site to GitHub,
where Travis CI does the build for GitHub Pages. I can't let GitHub Pages do
the build itself, because it doesn't support every gem I use.
