Hello! I'm David Gay.

The point my creating this blog is to write about thoughts, ideas, and
questions I have about software development and computer programming. For a
long time, I didn't blog because I am not particularly taken with the current
climate of writing for ad impressions and branding oneself. But I figured
there's no reason that I can't do my own thing. Maybe some other developer
will resonate with my meditations and will [send me a nice, validating
email](mailto:hello@davidgay.org). Who knows.

My favorite programming language is Ruby. My first was BASIC. Most recently,
I learned some Clojure.

I'm the lead software developer at [Kirkwork](https://kirkworkllc.com), but the
thoughts shared on this site are not necessarily those of Kirkwork, which is a
"limited liability company", which means it can have thoughts of its own.

## This Site

This site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay/davidgay.org).

I write all posts and pages in markdown, and then the site is generated by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is a slightly modified
[whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass). I push the site to GitHub,
where Travis CI does the build for GitHub Pages. I can't let GitHub Pages do
the build itself, because it doesn't support every gem I use.
