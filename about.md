Hello! I'm David Gay. [I'm a software developer.](https://github.com/dtgay) I
mostly write [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), my favorite programming
language. Besides programming, I read books, discover new music, listen to old
music, play [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) and
[roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), enjoy camping and fires,
play a little chess and guitar, and run a Pathfinder 2e game for some friends.
