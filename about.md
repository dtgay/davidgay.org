Hello! I'm David Gay.

The point of my creating this site is to write about things that interest me.
I spend a lot of my time doing software development, reading, and listening
to music, so much of the content will be about that.

My favorite programming language is Ruby. My first was BASIC. Most recently,
I learned some Clojure.

My favorite book is [Cat's
Cradle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) by Kurt
Vonnegut.

I don't have a favorite band. Some of my favorite albums are The Blue Nile's
[Hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hats_(album)) and Van Morrison's
[Astral Weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_Weeks).

I'm the lead software developer at [Kirkwork](https://kirkworkllc.com).

## Social

- **[Dev.to](https://dev.to/davidgay)** - I just made this when I found out
  it's an open-source Rails app and has some cool features. I probably won't
  be writing posts, though.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay)**
- **[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/davidgay)** - This is new this year
  and I'm sure I'm missing books.
- **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dtgay)** - New account,
  but it's the one I'm using going forward.
- **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/davidgay/)** - I just made this in May
  2020 and I certainly haven't logged everything I've seen yet.
- **[Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@david)** - I made one of these to check it
  out and would you look at that, I got @david on the Ruby instance! Cool!
- **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@davidgay)** - I upvote new tech
  I find cool, interesting, or useful.

## This Site

This site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay/davidgay.org).

I write all posts and pages in markdown, and then the site is generated by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is a slightly modified
[whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass). I push the site to GitHub,
where Travis CI does the build for GitHub Pages. I can't let GitHub Pages do
the build itself, because it doesn't support every gem I use.
