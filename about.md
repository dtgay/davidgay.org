Hello! I'm David Gay. Software developer. Reader. Writer. Listener.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1196465/david-gay?tab=profile)

Some stuff about me:

- My favorite programming language is Ruby. My first was BASIC. Most recently,
  I learned some Clojure.
- My favorite book is [Cat's Cradle][2] by Kurt Vonnegut.
- I don't have a favorite band. Two of my favorite albums are The Blue Nile's
  [Hats][3] and Van Morrison's [Astral Weeks][4].
- My favorite cat is Margalo. She lives in my house.
- I'm the lead software developer at [Kirkwork](https://kirkwork.co).

## This Site

This site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay/davidgay.org).

I write all posts and pages in markdown, and then the site is generated by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The theme is a slightly modified
[whiteglass](https://github.com/yous/whiteglass). I push the site to GitHub,
where Travis CI does the build for GitHub Pages. I can't let GitHub Pages do
the build itself, because it doesn't support every gem I use.

### No Tracking

I respect your privacy, so I use [GoatCounter][1] instead of something like
Google Analytics. GoatCounter [is open source][5] and doesn't collect any
personal data. I highly recommend it.
