Hello! I'm David Gay. [I'm a software developer.](https://github.com/dtgay).
I mostly write [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), my favorite programming
language. In my free time, I read books, listen to many kinds of music, enjoy
camping and fires, play a little guitar, run a Pathfinder 2e game for some
friends, and write more Ruby.

This site is [on GitHub](https://github.com/dtgay/davidgay.org).

I respect your privacy, so I use [GoatCounter][1] instead of something like
Google Analytics. GoatCounter [is open source][5] and doesn't collect any
personal data.
